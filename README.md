# HttpContextSubstitute

Easy mocking for ASP.NET Core HttpContext.

HttpContextSubstitute is an implementation of `AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext` that stores a Substitute.For<HttpContext> instance and works as a proxy for the real Mock.

## Installation

## Usage

Basic GET request:
```csharp

var context = new HttpContextSubstitute()
    .SetupUrl("http://localhost:8000/path")
    .SetupRequestMethod("GET");
```

POST request (with body):

```csharp
var data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("{\"Foo\":\"Bar\"");

var context = new HttpContextSubstitute()
    .SetupUrl("http://localhost:8000/path")
    .SetupRequestMethod("POST")
    .SetupRequestContentType("application/json")
    .SetupRequestBody(new MemoryStream(data))
    .SetupRequestContentLength(data.Length);
```

Request/Response pair, useful for testing Action Filters:

```csharp
var data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("{\"Foo\":\"Bar\"");

var context = new HttpContextSubstitute()
    .SetupUrl("http://localhost:8000/path")
    .SetupRequestMethod("GET")
    .SetupResponseContentType("application/json")
    .SetupResponseBody(new MemoryStream(data))
    .SetupResponseContentLength(data.Length);
```
